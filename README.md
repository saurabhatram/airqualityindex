# AirQualityIndex Prediction

A web-based air quality prediction ML model which takes in input features as Average Temperature (°C), Maximum temperature (°C), Minimum temperature (°C), Atmospheric pressure at sea level (hPa), Average relative humidity (%), Average visibility (Km), Average wind speed (Km/h), Maximum sustained wind speed (Km/h),
and predicts the AirQualityIndex.
# ML model used
Random Forest regression
